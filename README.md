The repo contains two branches, one used only for rendering the original figures (original_figures_rendering) and the other (main) contains the main branch we worked off.
This branch contains the code which produces the additional figures and animations related to how changes in latitude and wind stress impact ekman depth.
The main branch is what should be checked out and used. A switch input named "debug" can be used in the simulation function to determine whether to output the original figures or not.
